M-net Protocol Implementation for Python
========================================

First pass at implementing the Mita-Teknik M-net protocol used with WP3000/IC1000/IC1100 controllers.

This is most definitely a work in progress, and you are entirely on your own if you do something bad to your controller/turbi by using this code.

Known Packet Types

0x13a1 - some sort of login request? returns a packet_type 0x0001 with no data
0x0c28 - seems to make a request for a specific MAINID/SUBID specified in the data section - gets an 0x0c29 response
0x0c2a - seems to make a request for multiple MAINID/SUBIDs in the data, preceeded by the number of of requests, returns an 0x0c2b response.

0x1390 - seen in responses - seems to indicate an error.
